## What is discrete math?

Discrete math is the study of math that is discrete as opposed to continues. This is different than a continues math class like calculus because in calc if you pick two points on a graph there are infinitely many points in between them, while in discrete math there are only a finite number of points. Discrete math has a lot of applications in comp sci and is used in things like algorithms, data structures, and computer graphics.

## What are the four main topics that Professor Levin says will be presented in the book?

The four main topics are combinatorics, sequences, symbolic logic, and graph theory.

## What are discrete structures? Which specific examples are listed in the chapter? Briefly describe each of these.

Discrete structures: "They are the mathematical objects that we use to represent parts of the problems we are solving." The ones listed in the chapter are sets, functions, sequences, relations, and graphs. Sets are a collection of items. Functions are a relation between two sets where each item in the first set is related to exactly one item in the second set. Sequences are a list of items in a specific order. Relations are a set of ordered pairs. Graphs are a set of vertices.
