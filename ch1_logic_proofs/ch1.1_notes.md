## Premise, Conclusion, Argument

"An argument is a sequence of statements, the last of which is called the conclusion and the rest of which are called premises."

## Theorem

An idea that must be proven through a chain of logic and reasoning.

## Proposition

A statement that can be proven true or false.

## Proof

A construction a valid arguments to determine the truth of a theorem or proposition.

## Statement

A sentence that says something true or false.

## Quantifier

A symbol âˆ€ that specifies the quantity of elements for which a predicate holds.

## Predicate

A statement that has variables and becomes a proposition when said variables are given values.

## Logical Connective

An operator that combines propositions to form more complex logical statements.

## Binary Connective

A logical connective that operates on two propositions such as (and) or (or).

## Unary Connective

A logical connective that operates on a single proposition such as (not).

## Truth Value

The Boolean value (true or false) assigned to a proposition.

## Propositional Variables

Symbols representing basic statements that can be either true or false.

## Conjunction

The logical (and) true only if both propositions are true.

## Disjunction

The logical (or) true if at least one of the propositions is true.

## Implication

The logical (if-then) false only if the first statement is true and the second is false.

## Conditional

 Another term for implication expressing a dependency between statements.

## Biconditional

The logical (if and only if) true when both propositions have the same truth value.

## Negation

The logical (not) which inverts the truth value of a proposition.

## Truth Conditions

The circumstances under which a logical statement is true or false.
