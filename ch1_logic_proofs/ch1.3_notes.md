## Rules of Inference

Rules of Inference are fundamental principles used in logic to derive new statements from given statements. Here are some of the most common rules of inference:

Modus Ponens: If we have statements "If  P, then  Q " and "P," we can conclude "Q." 
Modus Tollens: If we have "If  P , then  Q " and " ¬ Q ," we can conclude " ¬ P ." 
Hypothetical Syllogism: If we have "If  P , then  Q " and "If  Q , then  R ," we can conclude "If  P , then  R ." 
Disjunctive Syllogism: If we have "P or Q" and " ¬ P ," we can conclude "Q." 
Addition: If we have "P," we can conclude "P or Q." 
Simplification: If we have "P and Q," we can conclude "P." 
Conjunction: If we have "P" and "Q," we can conclude "P and Q." 
Resolution: If we have "P or Q" and " ¬ P  or R," we can conclude "Q or R." 

These rules are used to construct logical arguments and proofs, ensuring that the conclusions we reach are valid based on the premises we start with.
