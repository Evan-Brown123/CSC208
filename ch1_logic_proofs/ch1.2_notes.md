- Contrapositive: For a given implication, it is the reverse and negation, represented as $\neg Q \rightarrow \neg P$.
- Inverse: For a given implication, it is the negation, represented as $\neg P \rightarrow \neg Q$
- Converse: For a given implication, it is the reverse, expressed as $Q \rightarrow P$.

## 2. Give an example of a true implication (written out in words) that has a false converse. Explain why your implication is true and why the converse is false.
Implication (True): "If it is raining, then the ground is wet."
This implication is generally true because rain falling will make the ground wet.

Converse of this implication:
Converse (False): "If the ground is wet, then it is raining."
This converse is false because the ground can be wet for reasons other than rain. For example, someone might have watered the garden, a sprinkler might be on, or there might have been a spill.

So, while the original implication is true, the converse is not necessarily true because it assumes that rain is the only cause for the ground being wet, which is not correct.
