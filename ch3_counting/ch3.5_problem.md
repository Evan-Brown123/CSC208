## Problem

Using the digits 2 through 7, find the number of different 5-digit numbers such that:

1. Digits cannot be repeated and must be written in **increasing** order.  
   *(Increasing means strictly increasing. For example, the digits of 134 are increasing, but the digits of 133 are not.)*

2. Digits **can be repeated** and must be written in **non-decreasing** order.  
   *(Now the digits donâ€™t need to be strictly increasing; 133 has digits non-decreasing.)*

## Solution

Let the digit set be:  
$\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$  
This gives us 6 possible digits to work with.

### Part 1: Strictly Increasing Digits (No Repeats)

I choose 5 **distinct** digits from 6 and arranging them in increasing order.  
There is only **one** way to arrange any set of distinct digits in increasing order.

So, the number of such numbers is:  
$\binom{6}{5} = 6$

### Part 2: Non-Decreasing Digits (Repeats Allowed)

I chose 5 digits from $\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$ **with repetition allowed** in **non-decreasing** order.

This is a "stars and bars" problem from the chapter: the number of multisets of size $r = 5$ from $n = 6$ elements is:
$\binom{r + n - 1}{r} = \binom{5 + 6 - 1}{5} = \binom{10}{5} = 252$

## Final Answers:

- **Strictly increasing (no repeats):** $\boxed{6}$
- **Non-decreasing (repeats allowed):** $\boxed{252}$
